## Note from Éloi S.

We are several in the team but I am in charge to overview the XR news and create the guide line of this project.

As an open source driven guy, my request to work on this project has been to keep a maximum of the works open to the community.  
"Life is to short for private code and NDA". 

I am not perfect so feel free to contact me if you want me to correct something in the project:  
issue, spelling, out-dated, info, ...
